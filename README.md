# ConSeqUMI

Welcome to ConSeqUMI! ConSeqUMI is a package that uses repeat inaccurate nanopore read sequences of a single sequence to determine the accurate consensus, or original, sequence. It can do this with multiple differently-barcoded sequences simultaneously. It was developed to aid [official name and link of English Lab UMI workflow here]. 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/ConSeqUMI/wiki) for installation instructions and walkthrough aids.
